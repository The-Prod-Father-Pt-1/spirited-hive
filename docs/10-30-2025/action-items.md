## Immediate Priority: Holiday Campaign Implementation

### 1. Landing Page (Homepage) - Holiday Reskin

**Design Requirements:**
- [ ] Change background to **bright red** throughout
- [ ] Add **Christmas string lights** at the top of the page
- [ ] Implement **snowfall effect** throughout the entire page
- [ ] Add snow mounds at the bottom (possibly with hive imagery)
- [ ] Update all photos to holiday-themed versions (Jack will provide)
- [ ] Update copy for "Hot for the Holidays" messaging
- [ ] Keep existing page structure/bones - this is a reskin, not a rebuild

**Technical Approach:**
- Clone live theme (DONE - "Hive for the Holidays" theme created)
- Hide current landing page so it can be toggled back easily
- Build holiday version as separate page that can be swapped in/out seasonally
- Ensure easy rollback capability

### 2. Product Page (Cranberry Vodka) - Holiday Edition

**Design Requirements:**
- [ ] Change background to **bright red**
- [ ] Add **snowfall effect** throughout page
- [ ] Update product photos to holiday-themed versions (Jack will provide)
- [ ] Keep existing page structure - reskin only

**Holiday Character Videos Section:**
- [ ] Add video section for four character skits (horizontal scroll layout)
- [ ] **Week 1 (Nov 1-2):** Add first video - Jack as himself making cocktails
- [ ] **Week 2 (Dec 1-7):** Add second video - Jack Griswold character
- [ ] **Week 3 (Dec 8-14):** Add third video - "Funcle Jack" character
- [ ] **Week 4 (Dec 15-21):** Add fourth video - "I Love Lucy Vitamin Benjamin" character
- [ ] Goal: All four videos live by Christmas

**Fake Reviews/Comments:**
- [ ] Implement fake reviews from holiday characters
  - Santa Claus
  - Rudolph
  - Other festive characters
- [ ] Style to match holiday theme

**Technical Approach:**
- Clone and hide current cranberry vodka product page
- Build holiday version for seasonal activation

### 3. Strive Website - Final Edits (Lower Priority)

**Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] Wait for final edits from Chris (expected end of day Oct 30)
- [ ] Implement final minor changes to close Strive project
- [ ] **Priority issue:** Get comments/reviews showing on Strive site
- [ ] Project payment: $7,500 via Stripe link once complete

## Development Workflow Protocol

**Established Protocol (from meeting):**
1. Clone the live theme for any changes to active site
2. Hide current pages (landing, product) for easy rollback
3. Build seasonal changes separately
4. Test thoroughly before switching live
5. Keep development themes for quick seasonal swaps

**Current Theme Status:**
- Live theme: "SH25 - Flow - Updated"
- Holiday dev theme: "Hive for the Holidays" (#15300195146)
- Development themes active and ready for work

## Success Criteria for Monday/Tuesday Checkpoint

By the Oct 31 @ 3:00 PM gut-check meeting, have:
1. Bright red background implemented on both pages
2. Snowfall effect working
3. Basic holiday layout structure in place
4. First character video section ready for content

**Note:** This is a "gift wrapping" project - reskinning existing pages, not building from scratch. Focus on efficiency while maintaining quality and brand consistency.
