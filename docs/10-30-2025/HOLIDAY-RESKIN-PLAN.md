## Holiday Reskin Tasks - Mapped to Files

### Task 1: Bright Red Background (BOTH PAGES)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Test completed (red showing in preview)

**Files to Edit:**
1. `assets/custom.css` - Add proper red background styling
   - Apply to body and main containers
   - Ensure content remains readable
   - Use `#DC143C` (Crimson) as Jack suggested

**Current Test Code (in custom.css):**
```css
/* HOLIDAY THEME TEST - Bright Red Background */
body {
  background-color: #DC143C !important;
}

body, .shopify-section {
  background-color: #DC143C !important;
}
```

**Action:**
- Refine this to apply cleanly to both pages
- May need section-specific overrides for proper coverage
- Test readability of text on red background

---

### Task 2: Christmas String Lights (LANDING PAGE ONLY)

**Files to Create/Edit:**

**NEW FILES:**
1. `assets/holiday-lights.css` - CSS for string lights animation
2. `snippets/holiday-lights.liquid` - HTML for light elements

**EDIT:**
3. `layout/theme.liquid` - Include the new files

**Implementation Plan:**
```liquid
<!-- In layout/theme.liquid head section -->
{{ 'holiday-lights.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}

<!-- In layout/theme.liquid body, after opening <body> tag -->
{% render 'holiday-lights' %}
```

**CSS Approach:**
- Create repeating light elements (circles)
- Alternate colors: red, green, blue, yellow
- Add blinking animation
- Position at top of viewport (fixed position)
- Use CSS keyframes for animation

---

### Task 3: Snowfall Effect (BOTH PAGES)

**Files to Create/Edit:**

**NEW FILES:**
1. `assets/holiday-snow.css` - CSS for falling snow animation
2. `snippets/holiday-snow.liquid` - HTML for snowflake elements

**EDIT:**
3. `layout/theme.liquid` - Include the new files

**Implementation Plan:**
```liquid
<!-- In layout/theme.liquid head section -->
{{ 'holiday-snow.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}

<!-- In layout/theme.liquid body, after opening <body> tag -->
{% render 'holiday-snow' %}
```

**CSS Approach:**
- Create 30-50 snowflake elements (performance balance)
- Use Unicode snowflake character: ‚ùÑ
- CSS animation: fall from top to bottom
- Randomize: horizontal position, animation delay, duration
- Use `position: fixed` and `z-index: 9999` to overlay entire page
- Mobile optimization: fewer flakes on small screens

---

### Task 4: Snow Mounds at Bottom (LANDING PAGE ONLY)

**Files to Create/Edit:**

**NEW FILE:**
1. `snippets/holiday-snow-mounds.liquid` - SVG or image of snow mounds

**EDIT:**
2. `layout/theme.liquid` or `templates/index.json` - Add mounds to bottom

**Implementation Plan:**
- Create SVG wave pattern to simulate snow mounds
- Position at bottom of viewport (fixed or absolute)
- Potentially add hive/honeycomb imagery within mounds
- White/light color to contrast with red background

---

### Task 5: Holiday Photos (BOTH PAGES)

- Template already has Loox reviews: `loox_reviews_loox_dynamic_section_EgUG4m`

{
  "name": "Holiday Reviews",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "review",
      "name": "Review",
      "settings": [
        {"type": "text", "id": "reviewer_name", "label": "Reviewer Name"},
        {"type": "text", "id": "reviewer_title", "label": "Title"},
        {"type": "number", "id": "rating", "label": "Star Rating"},
        {"type": "textarea", "id": "review_text", "label": "Review Text"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}
```
