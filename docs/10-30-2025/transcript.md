Gavin McNamara: Yo yo, doing good, man.
Jack Espy: How you doing, dude?
Gavin McNamara: Um, how was the shoot?
Jack Espy: Oh, it was good. It was non-stop. I literally flew in, got there late Monday night, woke up early, shot all day Tuesday, and then woke up early Wednesday and flew all the way back.
Gavin McNamara: Oh my god, dude. I saw I was trying to keep up with your posts and stuff, dude, and you were on the move.
Jack Espy: But it was like Yeah, dude. It was uh it was a lot. It was good. I'm excited for it to all come through. I think it's going to look it's going to look great.
Gavin McNamara: Hell yeah.
Jack Espy: So, I'm excited about that.
Gavin McNamara: f*** yeah, dude. Um, so what what what characters I maybe I'm spoiling this for myself, but what characters did he end up doing?
Jack Espy: So, I did four different characters. I did one which was just myself making cocktails. Uh second one was uh Jack Griswald.
 
 
00:00:57
 
Jack Espy: So, Clark Griswald, but I did Jack Griswald.
Gavin McNamara: Oh, perfect.
Jack Espy: Then I did like the fun uncle. So, funcle Jack.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: And then I did the I love Lucy like Vitamin of Benjamin thing.
Gavin McNamara: Dude, dude, you look great.
Jack Espy: Um, so those are the four. And it was like I'm like still tired from it. It was like Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: I'll be honest. for for as much as you wiggle around. I like I'm tired standing here. But dude, like I have nothing to complain about.
Jack Espy: I appreciate that, brother. Yeah, it's been uh it's been a lot, but I'm here for a couple of days. Joey gets here tomorrow, which I'm excited about. So, South Carolina.
Gavin McNamara: Are you in um are you in uh uh Southampton? South Carolina.
Jack Espy: Yeah, he's coming down, I think, to Yeah, he's coming down tomorrow.
Gavin McNamara: Oh, Joey's coming down. Nice.
Jack Espy: Um but yeah, it'll be good, dude.
 
 
00:01:51
 
Jack Espy: Um Tenny's here.
Gavin McNamara: Is Tammy gonna be there, too?
Jack Espy: Yeah, Tenny's here with the baby.
Gavin McNamara: Oh, awesome.
Jack Espy: Yeah, they got in yesterday, I think.
Gavin McNamara: Beauty. Well, you know, uh, got her hands full.
Jack Espy: Oh, yeah, that's for sure. That is for sure.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Um, well, cool, dude. Why don't we kick it on off? Let's, uh, let's dive into the email you shot over around kind of pricing and all of that.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: And you know, I think for me, and obviously this is boyto boy, just us talking a little bit of sticker shock on my end, but I totally, you know, I I think a lot of this kind of falls
Gavin McNamara: No. No.
Jack Espy: on me just because I was like, you know, super excited getting everything going and we were like, "Oh, let's keep going. Let's like, you know, figure this out, figure that out." Not realizing how much time you're spending on it. And you know, full transparency on our end, you know, we were looking to spend a lot less than that, but I get, you know, you put a lot of time and effort into it and it's looking awesome and we're super excited.
 
 
00:02:54
 
Jack Espy: I think if there's a way we can kind of get it closer to like 7,500, that would be huge. And then what I'm thinking between us is like going forward and again kind of this was like the first time working together so it was like kind of like a lot of back and forth.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: I think what would be awesome.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. We were having we were having fun with it, you know.
Jack Espy: Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's uh and like we should you know if we're not having fun then something's wrong.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. 100%.
Jack Espy: But if we could get it down to that and then what I'm thinking is like going forward what we could do is like putting a budget to each project.
Gavin McNamara: 100%.
Jack Espy: So then that way it's like you know you understand where we're coming like you understand the pricing and then we understand like what we could spend on it and then um go from there.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: So what I talked to Chris about this morning was getting those last tiny edits in to you.
 
 
00:03:49
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, yeah.
Jack Espy: Then you'll make those last changes and then we're done. that project's done. And then, you know, I think what what I was talking to Chris about is like what I would love to have is have you be on like with us like monthto monthth on one like any projects that come up. So like the hive website, you know, that minor like page change, whatever, that could be like one project. And then it could also be like, oh, Gav, we al we also need um you know this design mate.
Gavin McNamara: No. Yeah.
Jack Espy: Can we can you spend an hour doing that or whatever that is? Um, and maybe we could work like that rather than because I also I don't want to I don't want to jip you.
Gavin McNamara: Wonderful.
Jack Espy: And then I also don't want to just be like, "Oh, let's let's go for it."
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, dude.
Jack Espy: And oh, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Uh
Gavin McNamara: Dude, 100%, man. And like I just want to say like again like dude, really just appreciate this and like um I knew that that was going to be a sticker shock.
 
 
00:04:52
 
Gavin McNamara: Like I and like when I was doing like the math, I was like I knew like I was like this is not the number like going to go with. And I try to like word it without like making myself sound like a but like um I just like it's I'm just being candid, right?
Jack Espy: yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Like completely honest like I probably should never say this to anyone else, but like I would much rather have just done the work for free and like make sure that you guys are happy else, you know?
Jack Espy: Oh, totally. Yeah. Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: like um my what I care more about is how you guys feel and like us like working together and like having fun and like those things obviously like um you know got to like you know take care of
Jack Espy: Oh.
Gavin McNamara: the family but like um yeah like that's especially when it comes to like you know friends like close family close friends like it's um it's just a it's a weird thing that I'm like trying to figure out you
 
 
00:05:53
 
Jack Espy: Yeah. Oh, totally. Yeah. I mean, and that's the thing. It's like, you know, whenever and but also too, like we're in the business of making money, so it it's like it's a dabble in between.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: And you know, I think uh you know, I think I think going forward, I think that's like kind of the perfect spot where it's like, hey, you know, we help each other out, but also too, it's like, hey,
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. 100% dude.
Jack Espy: you know, this is kind of where we're coming from on both ends, you know. So, I think Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Absolutely. And like dude, like the like the best the best ideas and the best projects are going to come up like like on a like like a tip of a hat, you know, and you it's going to be like, "Hey Gab, can we do this really quick?" Like, and you know, the answer is going to be f*** yeah, obviously. But um yeah, like I think that that makes sense.
 
 
00:06:43
 
Gavin McNamara: Um and yeah, I like really appreciate it. And uh like the stuff that we're doing is f****** awesome, you know?
Jack Espy: Yeah, it's funny.
Gavin McNamara: And so, um, yeah, I just, you know, I'm happy we had this conversation. And it's for some reason just so weird for me, you know.
Jack Espy: No, dude. I mean, that's the way that it should be. should be like, "Hey, like this is realistically, you know, where I'm coming from." And it's always like this, like whenever I have, even if it's not a friend, you know, like it's like, "Hey, like I I totally see where you're coming from, but like can we meet somewhere in the middle?"
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, absolutely.
Jack Espy: And it's like, "Yeah, I mean, you know, it's always a conversation." So, I think we'll get that. So, once Chris shoots over these last edits, I don't think it's anything crazy. Well, you could make those and then we'll close that project. And then the idea with the Strive website going forward is like obviously we're gonna have some things where it's like, oh, we need to update this or we need to add this or what are because like what I
 
 
00:07:32
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: want to do is go to you and be like, hey, it's November 30th. Like what what has what traction did we bring to the site? Where are people falling off? What can we do to edit things? So then that way we can because I think the site's at like an 85% and we'll be able to get it to 100% but it's going to take some time to do that.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: So I want to keep you on to figure that out and we can figure out like what that looks like from a price standpoint maybe it's just like hourly and then when we have these projects then we could work on those these projects together. Um so if that works for you then that would be awesome.
Gavin McNamara: Mhm. Dude, absolutely. You know, um yeah, that definitely works. And like we'll figure out like what the what works for hourly like the the other thing too, right? Like the like for both Strive and Hive, it was there was like probably like four hours a piece of just like getting things set up, you know?
 
 
00:08:43
 
Gavin McNamara: Um, and so like, you know, I think that when it comes down to like time and stuff, like it's it's a little, you know, like I it can take a like a a little bit long on my end.
Jack Espy: Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: Um, not that it's, you know, easy stuff. It's just like to get things cooking. But now that I have things set up there, like things are going to cruise a lot seamlessly, if that makes sense.
Jack Espy: Sweet. Cool. Cool. Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: No, that's that's perfect. And I guess for us on the hive, have you started on that one yet?
Gavin McNamara: So, I have I've ran into um a couple of issues with getting it to like actually show up on um in like the themed store. So, not like the live store, but like I So, what I ended up doing was cloned the the theme.
Jack Espy: 15. Well, that's good. Sorry to interrupt you. That's kind of what we want because we don't want because the the Strive was different where it was like we're we don't give a s***.
 
 
00:09:37
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Edit that in time. I don't care because like anything's better than what that was. Whereas this is like the hive sight's actually cranking and people are going on to it.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: So, it's like I want to edit that in theme in the theme whatever and then transfer it over once it's all done. Oh, I think you put me at Can you hear me? I can't hear you right now. What the heck just happened?
Gavin McNamara: Can Can you hear me, dude?
Jack Espy: Oh, now I can hear you. That was weird.
Gavin McNamara: It connected to my um my phone's microphone for some weird reason. I don't know what's going on, but I could hear you.
Jack Espy: Weird.
Gavin McNamara: Perfect. Um and yeah, like for with Hive, right? Like there's there's a ton of traction, right? And the site is is very it's it's a lot more like welldeveloped. And so like I'm like, "All right, with these things, especially when it comes to like swapping out like a landing page and a product page, um like we want to I want to make sure that I'm following like
 
 
00:10:34
 
Jack Espy: Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: the right protocols where it's like, all right, clone the theme, then actually just hide the current pages." So, it's like hide the one product page for the cranberry vodka, hide the landing page as it is, so we can flip it back on like a switch of a dime.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Like one, if something's like not working, or two, like when the season's over, right?
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Um, and then you have them too, so you can go back and forth, you know, throughout the the seasons um moving forward.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: But yeah, want to keep it separate and that's why I was I probably bothered someone on the team like I was kept like emailing but uh I just kept getting blocked by um like trying to actually grab like the the project and start actually Yeah.
Jack Espy: Okay, cool.
Gavin McNamara: But now it's all f*** you.
Jack Espy: No, that sounds great. That sounds great. Yeah. And what we're I guess from like a price perspective on that one, we can talk about that on like what we want to do because like obviously I want it to look sick, but I don't want it to be like all the bells and whistles where it's like, "Oh, this is be like over $1,000 or whatever there."
 
 
00:11:46
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: I'm like, okay, like maybe let's just keep it around that like 800 to a,000 or something like that.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: Whatever you're thinking there would be perfect because our whole thing is it's kind of like a balancing scale for us because the thing that's hard is you know this project all in with content all of that is going
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: to be around like updating the website all that s*** is going to be like six grand maybe more.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, dude.
Jack Espy: So, it's like we need to make sure that we bring in more than six grand in revenue.
Gavin McNamara: 100%.
Jack Espy: Um, yeah.
Gavin McNamara: And and again, right, like I think that this is a perfect opportunity for like it's like all right, like this is this is how you know we we help each other, right? And then what I can do is like um use Spirited Hive as like a um like a proud partner, you know, and then be able to even get SEO that way.
Jack Espy: Yeah. Yeah.
 
 
00:12:47
 
Gavin McNamara: So it goes you get ad traction through my site as well as and so it's like a win-win, you know.
Jack Espy: Yeah. And whatever I can do too from um like trying to connect you with other people that need web development stuff because like you could totally put on your website like the whole Strive website like hey I developed this
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, dude.
Jack Espy: whole thing.
Gavin McNamara: That would be amazing. Honestly, I was I was going to ask too um if that was cool, but um dude, perfect.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Like that's dude, like you're like I'm going to sound like a cheeseball, but I I really it's just who I am.
Jack Espy: Yeah, of course.
Gavin McNamara: Um, and you know this, uh, like working with you is has been like so nice. Um, you know, compared to not saying that like working with other people stinks, but it's, um, trying to get new business is hit or miss with the people you work with, right?
Jack Espy: Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: So like if there's anyone that you like, all right, this, you know, someone else is, you know, looking for something like obviously good dudes know good dudes and so, you know, I trust your your judgment.
 
 
00:13:44
 
Jack Espy: Yeah. Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Um, I got this one doctor right now who's such a pain in the ass, dude. I'll be honest. He's like, "Can you make me this 3D brain that rotates?" And like, "Oh, I told you." With the music on the site, I'm like I'm like, "Uh, sure. If
Jack Espy: Music. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: you really want it." Nice.
Jack Espy: Dude, of course. Yeah, I've I'm actually going to a big founder event um next weekend in Texas, so I'll be around like a s*** ton of founders. So, um and I had to submit my website and stuff like that for them to review.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: So, I'll definitely bring it up.
Gavin McNamara: Dude, you are the best.
Jack Espy: Yeah, of course, dude. 100%.
Gavin McNamara: It's And so like with the the um spirited hive stuff.
Jack Espy: Cool.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, let's let's do you know 800 like you said if that's cool. Um yeah, and um like as I'm you know because like the way that I've been doing that like the the hourly with other people obviously it's it's just like a there's like a big gray area for me right
 
 
00:14:41
 
Jack Espy: Yeah, great.
Gavin McNamara: now. I'm like, "All right, like you know, uh, for particular like projects that are much smaller, like maybe a day, like I'll do an hourly rate for some people." And, um, you know, those are like, you know, for more like enterprise customers where they're like, "Yeah, like you're a contractor, that's what, you know, it costs." But then for the stuff that I actually I care about, um, like this stuff, right? Like I think it's just Yeah, I'm still like if we if I put back my like the menty mentor hat on, I'm still trying to figure out that like how to how to price s***.
Jack Espy: And I think that's something that you'll get to as you start doing more uh not only websites but I think like rule of thumb that I've seen in web development world is soup to nuts web development at a because you're you're going to grow to the place where you can you know get because you can't start here. You have to start like here where it's like hey you know uh just and obviously you know not saying fake it till you make it but almost kind of like yeah like I've worked with you know now you
 
 
00:15:59
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. 100%. Yeah.
Jack Espy: can use the hive page you can use page you can use Joey's you have these other pages that you can show off but usually soup to nuts from like nothing like a blank blank slate to everything done is
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: like on like the low to middle tier would be so like the hive site we got that one done for I think 3500 to four grand and that's like yeah so and then the next tier
Gavin McNamara: really yeah.
Jack Espy: is like for like a f****** kick out like where you bring on like a full-on agency to do a website it's anywhere between like 15 and 20K, maybe up to 25K, like some of those websites. And then there's some websites that have so much integration that are like 50 grand. Um, but I would probably charge from like soup to nuts. I'd probably charge like 10 to 12 for you.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Like soup to nuts, like you're doing everything.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Um yeah.
 
 
00:17:16
 
Gavin McNamara: 100%, dude. I appreciate that. It's uh it's funny. It's like when I worked with you know contractors at Axon and you know the even with um how right like it's insane and also it's a whole different product game like e-commerce right like is is like a new territory for me overall compared to like building like a pro like a product right that's like uh like I'm building you know for for Nichollet and Bobby like the the sprout registry you know where it's like coming up
Jack Espy: Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: like an algorithm for search and like all these different things, right?
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Like it's it's all um yeah, it's it's I think I'm just like overthinking pieces of it just because it's like so fresh and I'm like I want to keep this going. Um you know, and like I last thing I want to do, but I might have to at some point is like get a you know, another job and then have to do this, you know, on the side, but
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: I'm going to try to avoid that as much as possible.
 
 
00:18:18
 
Jack Espy: Well, yeah. And I think where you can get to with that is, you know, I think Yeah. I mean, you could always run ads. I mean, but then you're I don't know. Ads are always hit or miss for me where it's like because right now it's like word of mouth, right?
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, dude. It's Well, I have ads like up and running. Um, and I get like a decent amount of like foot like uh like ad traffic, but not on social media.
Jack Espy: Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: Um, specifically like through um Google and through um like ChatG. Um but like when they come to the site it's you know um it's like two pieces. One is like you know a recurring you know monthtomonth for like some of the tools and then like this new piece which is like more of like all right like AI consulting you know that's like the best way I could put it. Um, you know, it's I'm working on getting I actually have the um the intern right now like building out like the calendar the calendarly integration and like figuring out what deals we could pick up.
 
 
00:19:28
 
Gavin McNamara: But um yeah, like we made nothing so far like through foot traffic or ad traffic yet, but um I didn't I didn't anticipate it would be like a million dollars first year, you know?
Jack Espy: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, even for us, dude, I mean, we just started.
Gavin McNamara: Definitely.
Jack Espy: I mean, we did we've been doing ads for like It takes a while. like it takes a lot longer than I was expecting. Um but uh yeah, no it is.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, it's humbling in a good way. You know, it's like, you know, it helps you grow, but it's uh yeah, like trying to do ads, like I'm paying like probably too much for ads right now, I'll be honest.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Like I'm paying like like $1,000 a month just for ads to run. Um, and then like the tools that I use to build, um, probably close to $1,000 a month on those things.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: And so it's, uh, I think I just need to be a little bit smarter.
 
 
00:20:22
 
Gavin McNamara: Like I'm used to when I was at my cushy job at Axon, right? Like I was able to play around a lot more and now I'm like, "Yeah, I probably should learn like how to be better with money." So yeah.
Jack Espy: Yeah. But that's with anything now. I mean, that's even like even for me. I mean, like, f***. Hey, like I 100% need to be better with money. I'm like, "Where can I save? Where
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: can I do this? Where can I do that?" And you don't have to do it until you're in a spot where you're like, "Oh, f***." You know what I mean?
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. 100%, dude. And it's like one of those things that like I've just it's I I keep pushing it off and I have to be honest with myself and then like you know before I know it I'm like f*** all right I have like three credit cards I need to pay off and got to pay you know make sure that Aaron's taking care of the bills and I'm like the ups and downs of having like that corporate job versus trying to make it myself like I still genuinely genuinely believe that like I I have something that could be great.
 
 
00:21:24
 
Gavin McNamara: Um, lots to learn obviously, but um, yeah, it's like tempting.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: It's like really tempting to be like, okay, like I need to pay off XYZ credit cards and like I have the taxes to pay and so like you know if I got another job then I maybe I'll ask for like a signing like a sign on bonus but then like kind of like diminishing the dream that I taking a swing at this thing and I feel like I haven't given it enough time to even let it like gain traction.
Jack Espy: Yeah. And it's it's normal to have those thoughts. I have those thoughts every single day.
Gavin McNamara: All right, we do.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Okay.
Jack Espy: Yeah. But yeah, dude. It's so normal to have if you're not having those thoughts, then it doesn't matter to you, you know?
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: You know, because it's like Yeah. Don't Don't get too down on yourself about having those thoughts. I and I still get down on myself like what are you doing dude?
 
 
00:22:16
 
Jack Espy: Like I have thoughts where I'm like oh f*** if these things don't work out like I've never worked for someone before like what am I going to do?
Gavin McNamara: No. Dude, absolutely.
Jack Espy: How's that going to work? But it's just normal. I mean it's normal. That's just your brain being your brain and just taking you all down all these different rabbit holes and all that s***. So yeah,
Gavin McNamara: And like it's easy for your brain to kind of tell you these things, right? Because it's like the the uh I think it's just part of being human. But like it's like seeing seeing you seeing how hard you work and seeing like the content you put out, the product and like literally like how good it f****** tastes. Like dude, like you could work anywhere, you know, at any point.
Jack Espy: I appreciate that.
Gavin McNamara: Not saying you should by any means. You should just keep doing exactly what you're doing. But um it's you know I think it's a there's a lot that comes with being a founder and it's a lot more than when you're working for someone else.
 
 
00:23:18
 
Gavin McNamara: You know there's them bad right?
Jack Espy: Yeah, you have that drive. Yeah. And I think for you it's um again it's always going back to that idea of what happens happens and everything happens for a reason. And also too it's like you know just eb and flow and don't put too much pressure on any given thing. It's obviously good to have stressors in your life.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: good stressors and you can always frame your mind to this whole, you know, thing where it's like, oh, should I get another job? It's like, well, have that motivate you not to get another job, you know, try to do whatever you can to not have that happen, but do it in a way that isn't like deteriorating you, you know, personally and
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: make you kind of go down different rabbit holes and all those kind of things.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: And that's, you know, so I know I know you'll be able to figure it out and whatever I can do to help you too from trying to drum up some new business for you or whatever I can do,
 
 
00:24:14
 
Gavin McNamara: 100%.
Jack Espy: just let me know. And um yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, dude. I appreciate it. And you know, at the end of the day, like um dude, like I'm just stoked to be working with you. And like I feel like even just like us being homies and working together, it's just like doesn't feel like work like to me, you know?
Jack Espy: Oh
Gavin McNamara: like it's it's just great. Um and like I think that's another driving thing where it's like you know working with if I didn't do this I wouldn't have had this opportunity to like you know work with you and like you know help you know build strive and hive and you know different ways and get your vision out there but also like you like being you know like a mentor to me like as well you know and like those particular things. Um, but yeah, dude. You know, I think that the most that I've learned is like when I put more pressure on myself, that's when things tend to like really start slowing down, but when I just let it flow and like it's a
 
 
00:25:23
 
Jack Espy: Yeah. Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: hard thing to do. Um, you know, and I battle with it every single day, but um, when I do, it ends up being a lot more fluid.
Jack Espy: Totally.
Gavin McNamara: And you know what I'm saying?
Jack Espy: I couldn't agree more. I think my biggest thing whenever I get into like a rut or I get like down on myself or whatever, it's always when I feel like I'm not working hard enough and I'm like, "Ah, like you got to
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: work harder." Like, "What are you doing?" And then I like I'm like, "That's just your brain playing tricks on you." And once you let it go and you're just like, then I feel like I catch my groove.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: I do whatever. I'm happier and all that kind of stuff because that negative selft talk is going to happen regardless, you know?
Gavin McNamara: You're 100%.
Jack Espy: And it's just trying to silence it and or just kind of frame of thought, you know, like how are you, you know, and I think writing everything down for me always helps where it's like, you know, having something
 
 
00:26:15
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: that you're working towards or checking the box on whatever it is always helps me. and just knowing that you're going towards, you know, a mountain and you're working towards, you know, trying to get at the top of that peak and obviously you have valleys in between that you have to go through and
Gavin McNamara: Oh yeah.
Jack Espy: you have false summits and all that kind of s***. So, it's just a part of the process. And hey, at the end of the day, if you know the mountain is too tall or whatever it is, you can always you can always take a different route or go climb a new mountain, you know.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: It's so true, dude. And like um at the end of the day, I think what McConn says is like perfect. It's like I just gota like full ass it, you know, because if it I halfass halfass it, right? Not saying I am, but it's, you know, constant feeling of like needing to do more, right?
 
 
00:27:12
 
Gavin McNamara: Where I'm just like, s***, I'm not doing enough, you know? Then there will be days where I'm working way too hard and like I'm like not sleeping. Um, but if I don't full ass this, then I will sit and wonder if I could have ever done it to begin with.
Jack Espy: Yeah. Yeah. I mean like Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: That's a nightmare for me.
Jack Espy: It's always the regret of, you know, it's always the regret of like not taking the step rather than taking the step, you know.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: So, I agree. And I think it's just giving yourself grace on, you know, knowing that you've done enough as long as you actually have, you know, and I think that's that's the big thing.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Jack Espy: And that's where I I struggle with that every single day where it's like, am I doing enough? And I'm like like trying to look at like is there anything I haven't done? Like I need to I need to always feel like I'm doing something or I'm sitting at my desk or whatever.
 
 
00:28:05
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: And in hindsight I don't. I mean I could be on the move.
Gavin McNamara: No. Yeah.
Jack Espy: I could be doing f****** whatever and still working.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: But yeah, man. I mean you'll you'll get it all figured out and I'm always here for you no matter what. Um, so yeah, dude.
Gavin McNamara: I appreciate that, man. Yeah. I love you, brother. And it's uh you know these these moments here just talking through this is like this is what I love, you know.
Jack Espy: Me too.
Gavin McNamara: um the the real the real spiel, you know, and and not to to pivot because I've honestly I was just thinking in my head, I'm just going to think out loud again.
Jack Espy: Me too. Oh, 100%. 100%. Um, oh, dude.
Gavin McNamara: I was like, we should do a podcast together or something.
Jack Espy: Yeah, we get easy into a podcast.
Gavin McNamara: You know what?
Jack Espy: I'm actually going to be on a podcast here in 30 minutes.
 
 
00:28:56
 
Jack Espy: Yeah, I do podcast every once in a while.
Gavin McNamara: f*** yeah, dude.
Jack Espy: Um, I paid this dude and I wish I had never done it because it's all like online podcasts and like online podcasts like in my opinion are like like no one f****** watches them and I've drum up a
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: little bit of business through some of these podcasts that I've done. I've probably done like 30 20 20 to 30 of them.
Gavin McNamara: Holy s***.
Jack Espy: And um yeah, but like you go online and like you look at the views and it's always like maybe a hundred at the most.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: So it's like is it really worth it?
Gavin McNamara: It's good practice though, right? Like getting out there.
Jack Espy: It's great practice. I mean it's great talking and you know telling my story, telling you know my ups, my downs, all those kind of things.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, dude. That's f****** badass. Um I can't believe you have a podcast in 30 minutes.
 
 
00:29:47
 
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: That'sing awesome. Um what is who's the uh the podcaster?
Jack Espy: What's his name? Ryan. The Ryan Hanley Show.
Gavin McNamara: Brian Hanley. I feel like that sounds familiar.
Jack Espy: I'll Yeah. No, probably not. I mean, he's got like I think I just was on his YouTube. He's got like average listeners of like most views he's gotten on his podcast videos is like 100. And he seems kind of like a little intense.
Gavin McNamara: Interesting, dude.
Jack Espy: So I'm like, "Okay, here we go. See what comes." Oh,
Gavin McNamara: Well, whatever it is, you know, you're a f****** you're jack m************ SP, so you can handle handle it all. Um, yeah, that's wild.
Jack Espy: I love it. Um well last well I guess a couple of things on my end before well I guess what would be great is if we could look at is there a way to share what you've done on the hive side
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: or is that not ready yet and then but while we're while you're pulling that up so I guess what we can do is Chris will send over those last edits on the Strive side if you just make those
 
 
00:30:49
 
Gavin McNamara: So, I was trying to get it to work right before this. Let me see. Um yeah.
Jack Espy: last little bit of edits then we'll We'll iron we'll we'll call that project done for the time being.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: We'll get everything paid out. The 7500 we'll get that just let me know how you want that to be paid. We'll get you paid on that and then we can work on the next project which is Hive.
Gavin McNamara: Yep.
Jack Espy: Timing on that I mean is kind of soon. I mean, if we could have it somewhat done by like Monday or Tuesday of next week on like just having it like look like red holiday themed, having like those comment things down.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, absolutely.
Jack Espy: Um, that would be great.
Gavin McNamara: Absolutely.
Jack Espy: And then I'm thinking on the Strive side, did we ever get the comments figured out on the Strive side?
Gavin McNamara: I don't think we did. No, that's something that uh I need to need to prioritize. Um, and I feel like it's what like once I dig into it, like it's um like we're talking about like the reviews, right?
 
 
00:31:58
 
Jack Espy: Yeah. So, the reviews that I guess kind of I went two different ways on that one. The reviews on the Strive, if we could just get it so it's showing, that'd be excellent. And then, um, the Hive one will just be kind of like fake reviews that are like Santa, Rudolph, you know, those kind of things.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: That would be great. Um,
Gavin McNamara: Dude, I gotta show you what I what I've done because like I've I haven't been able to push it up to um to actual Shopify, but let me and like this is just like real, you know, this is just the beginning, so I don't want it to be like, you know, it looks like s*** because I get it if that was their knee-jerk reaction. Um let me uh see if I can switch you over to this computer.
Jack Espy: Yeah, just we doing like a little Halloween party down here with the fans. So for that, which would be great.
Gavin McNamara: I love it.
Jack Espy: Oh, whoa, you're over here now.
 
 
00:33:11
 
Jack Espy: Here, while you're pulling that up, I'm just going to go pee real quick. I'll be right
Gavin McNamara: Yep.
Jack Espy: All righty.
Gavin McNamara: All right, let's see. later. Here we go. So, this is what I have locally right now. Most of it is most of it is um like what what we're seeing here is like a static page.
Jack Espy: Okay.
Gavin McNamara: Um but it's like more like the containers that I'm building out. And so and it look like like basic animation uh you know um you know the product image was thinking of going here or we can have some type of animation where you know uh maybe it's you in the
Jack Espy: Mhm.
Gavin McNamara: product or what whatever we want to be.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Um then I was thinking about for the character skits down for like the second fold. Um there's going to be four of them, right? So, we want to do the horizontal scroll or do we want to try to do vertical?
Jack Espy: Yeah.
 
 
00:34:52
 
Gavin McNamara: Like I guess what I'm thinking about is mobile view. Let's see.
Jack Espy: Well, so how it'll work it just like timing wise. Oh, cool. Here we go.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, too many of these.
Jack Espy: Oh, this is great. And what I'm thinking is like I love the setup for it. Obviously, we'll get the we'll get the fonts and all that added in. I think having it be like I love the snow falling at the top, but I would love to have all this be like like bright red
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: like like the background.
Gavin McNamara: Bright run. Okay.
Jack Espy: So like here let me just let me just think about this. So let me share this. So like all the white would Can you see my screen?
Gavin McNamara: I can.
Jack Espy: So all the white here would be like bright red and then like so this would still look the same.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: This would have like, you know, the updated the updated um f****** copy here.
 
 
00:36:07
 
Jack Espy: Scroll down. These images would be updated. And then here, maybe we could we could move this down, this part down. And then it would have all the stuff that you have right there. So, it' be like videos. It would have um you know, everything else that you're showing, but like bright red. And then like um you know like the snow falling maybe throughout the whole entire thing would be really cool.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack Espy: But I like where you're at. I think it's looking really good.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. It's it's um like I was toying around with some of like the like the way that I was thinking about like how to place it out, but I love that. I think that's a great reference how bright red um you know essentially like with how the site's laid out. We'll move those one piece down.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Um and we'll have the snowfall maybe at the bottom we can have like like a snow mound or something.
 
 
00:36:56
 
Jack Espy: Yeah, that'd be cool.
Gavin McNamara: Um and some and some like uh some hives in it or something.
Jack Espy: Yeah, I love that.
Gavin McNamara: Um, yeah.
Jack Espy: Yeah, because like we'll keep the page looking the exact same, but obviously like adding in the Christmasy photos, maybe snowfall throughout the page um how it already is.
Gavin McNamara: No, no, no.
Jack Espy: Update the copy. Then have the holiday character skits like one, two, three, four. We'll start with one because that's launching November uh first or second whenever we can get this updated. We'll put that and that's just like me being myself making the cocktails.
Gavin McNamara: 100%. Yeah.
Jack Espy: Then we'll slowly start to add in the other videos once they go live. So the idea is we're going to start having them go live every week of December 1st through I think the 15th. We'll do one every week so that we can by the end of it, right before Christmas, this site is like four videos, super like holiday themed, very funny, all that.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
 
 
00:37:53
 
Gavin McNamara: Hell yeah, dude. Absolutely. Um, yeah, we're going to have fun with this one. And I think it helps too like rather than like like a a zero like zero to one, it's like the the products page is already there.
Jack Espy: Reskinning it to make it look holiday themed.
Gavin McNamara: It's like reskinning it of gift wrapping it, you know?
Jack Espy: Yeah. GIF wrapping the vodka cranberry hot. Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, there we go. And then for the landing page, um, are we is that going to do are we look thinking the same thing like a reskin of the No, sorry, silly question. This is like what the landing page was going to be like the Yeah.
Jack Espy: Yeah. I think that I think the landing page. Um yeah, maybe we have the landing page maybe. Um just scroll or I guess not the L. Yeah, I guess like the homepage the top part would just be here.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Let me share.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: So maybe here what we do is we just change this.
 
 
00:39:04
 
Jack Espy: Maybe we make this red for the time being with like some Christmas like Christmas string lights or something up here.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Um, can you see my cursor?
Gavin McNamara: I I don't know. Are you moving it? Yeah, I can.
Jack Espy: Okay. So, I'm thinking like string lights maybe up here. Make this red. Then have, you know, we'll have some holiday photos for you that we'll be able to put here.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: And then it's just it's hot for the holidays shop. And then it could be like, you know, shot the vodka crayon like how you have it on your side. Um, and we could have like the snow falling. So, pretty much what you have just kind of updating a little bit.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Um, but I think that Yeah, you have the bones there.
Gavin McNamara: It's it's kind of like keeping it like the again like it's I think it's a great reference because it's like um you have the the bones there right for the paint.
 
 
00:39:53
 
Jack Espy: It's just kind of redoing it a little bit.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. 100%. Okay. And like adding some cool some cool s*** like you know um Christmas lights or you know whatever whatever we we want to do but like not building it from scratch you know.
Jack Espy: Yeah. No. Yeah, exactly.
Gavin McNamara: Perfect. No makes complete sense. Um yeah. So what I'll do is um if we want to if um we want to prioritize do we want to prioritize the rest of this drive stuff before the hive?
Jack Espy: Why don't we do this? Let's see what edits. Why don't you start working on the hive stuff today?
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, perfect.
Jack Espy: Um, so start working on that. Chris is going to get me the or get you the edits by the end of the day today for Strive. See what they are because I I don't think they're that many. So maybe if anything those can be tweaked, but I mean the main priority is like getting this done by Monday, Tuesday.
 
 
00:40:48
 
Gavin McNamara: Yeah.
Jack Espy: Um, and I'm also free tomorrow, too. So, if you want to take if you want to, we could throw like 15 minutes on the books for tomorrow just to kind of get like a gut check of like, hey, this is where we're at with it.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.
Jack Espy: Let me know your thoughts. Like, do you like it? Do you not like it? Do you want to move this way or that way?
Gavin McNamara: 100%.
Jack Espy: So, we throw some time on the book tomorrow to cover that.
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, I'll I'll put on a a meeting tomorrow for us. Um, let's do Yeah, I think 15 minutes is perfect, right? It's like kind of like you said, a gut check. Um, because if it's for some reason like way off, better to know, you know, up front or if it's like, yeah, now we can move forward.
Jack Espy: Yeah.
Gavin McNamara: Totally makes sense. Um, what time works best for you?
Jack Espy: Um, do you want to do 11 to 11:30?
 
 
00:41:41
 
Gavin McNamara: Let me see. f*** yeah. Let's do 11. Actually, um I have I have a meeting with a potential customer from 11 to 11:30.
Jack Espy: Will that give you enough time or do you want to do it later in the day?
Gavin McNamara: Um if we could do anything after and then I have a one that's from 1:30 to 2 with the doctor. Besides that, I'm good. So, if we want to do like noon, is that possible.
Jack Espy: I've got meetings from 11:30 to 3. H Why don't we do from 3:00 to 3:30?
Gavin McNamara: Okay, perfect.
Jack Espy: or 3 to 3:15.

And then we could also look at like end of week check-ins where maybe we take, you know, an hour of your time to just run through like the analytics um on everything and then get your thoughts on like,
Gavin McNamara: No, absolutely.
Jack Espy: okay, like this is happening. What should we do from a website perspective to like optimize or whatever?
Gavin McNamara: Yeah, there's there's so much and and there's so much with that there's so much that people aren't doing that I think would be really smart to do at a like a cheaper than ads I'll say you know um
