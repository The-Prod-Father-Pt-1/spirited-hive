Details
Post-Shoot Debrief and Character Roles Jack Espy shared details about their recent non-stop, two-day shoot where they played four characters: themself making cocktails, Jack Griswald, Funcle Jack (the fun uncle), and the I Love Lucy Vitamin of Benjamin character (00:00:00). They also mentioned that Joey and Tenny, who arrived yesterday with the baby, are in South Carolina (00:00:57).
Pricing Discussion for Current Project The conversation shifted to pricing, where Jack Espy expressed "sticker shock" over the cost but acknowledged the time and effort Gavin McNamara put into the work (00:01:51). Jack Espy suggested getting the current project closer to $7,500 and proposed that for future collaborations, they establish a budget for each project to ensure mutual understanding of pricing and spending limits (00:02:54). Gavin McNamara appreciated the candid discussion and agreed with the proposed approach for future projects (00:03:49) (00:05:53).
Future Collaboration and Project Management Jack Espy proposed moving to a month-to-month arrangement with Gavin McNamara for any upcoming projects, such as minor page changes for the Hive website or new design work, to avoid overspending or underpaying (00:03:49). Gavin McNamara agreed with this arrangement, and Jack Espy noted the business context of needing to make money while helping each other (00:05:53). The current project will be closed once Chris provides the last few tiny edits for Gavin McNamara to implement (00:03:49) (00:06:43).
Strive Website Updates and Future Plans Jack Espy outlined the future vision for the Strive website, which involves keeping Gavin McNamara on to analyze site traction, identify where people are dropping off, and implement edits to reach 100% optimization (00:06:43). They suggested an hourly rate for this ongoing optimization work, in addition to project-based assignments (00:07:32). Gavin McNamara affirmed that the setup for both Strive and Hive is now in place, which should make future work cruise more seamlessly (00:08:43).
Hive Website Development Status and Protocol Gavin McNamara reported running into issues getting the Hive theme to show up in the theme store, though they successfully cloned the theme, which Jack Espy confirmed is the preferred approach for the actively performing Hive site (00:08:43). The desired protocol involves cloning the theme, hiding current pages (like the landing and cranberry vodka product pages) for easy rollback, and ensuring separate development for seasonal changes (00:09:37).
Pricing for Hive Website Updates Jack Espy suggested keeping the cost for the Hive website updates, which will involve reskinning rather than a full rebuild, around $800 to $1,000 (00:10:34). They emphasized the need to balance project costs, noting that the overall content and website update project is budgeted around six thousand dollars, which must be surpassed by revenue (00:11:46).
Partnership and SEO Benefits Gavin McNamara proposed using Spirited Hive as a "proud partner" to leverage SEO and provide ad traction through their own site, creating a win-win scenario for both parties (00:11:46). Jack Espy encouraged Gavin McNamara to display the Strive website on their portfolio (00:12:47).
Web Development Pricing Context and Self-Reflection Gavin McNamara agreed to the $800 price for the Spirited Hive work (00:13:44). They reflected on the challenge of correctly pricing their work, especially for smaller projects and in the e-commerce domain, admitting they are still trying to figure out how to price their services (00:14:41) (00:17:16). Jack Espy provided industry context, suggesting that a soup-to-nuts web development project for someone at Gavin McNamara's stage should be priced around $10,000 to $12,000, contrasting it with the Hive site's cost of $3,500 to $4,000 and agency costs of up to $25,000 (00:15:59).
Marketing and Financial Management Challenges Gavin McNamara discussed their current use of ads on Google and ChatG, noting that they spend about $1,000 monthly on ads and another $1,000 on tools, but have not yet generated revenue from foot or ad traffic (00:18:18). Both acknowledged the difficulty and slow progress of ads and the shared need to be smarter with money, stemming from previous corporate job stability (00:19:28). Gavin McNamara is also battling the temptation to return to a corporate job for financial stability, which would diminish their entrepreneurial dream (00:21:24).
Mental Challenges of Being a Founder Jack Espy and Gavin McNamara discussed the normalcy of self-doubt and financial stressors as founders (00:21:24). Jack Espy advised Gavin McNamara not to put too much pressure on themself and to allow the dream to motivate them, encouraging them to focus on giving their venture enough time to gain traction (00:23:18). Gavin McNamara emphasized that working with Jack Espy and letting things flow, rather than putting too much pressure on themself, leads to more fluid progress (00:24:14).
Podcast Discussion Jack Espy mentioned they have a podcast recording scheduled shortly and shared their experience with online podcasts, noting that while they offer good practice and opportunities to tell their story, viewership is typically low (00:28:05).
Project Next Steps and Payment Jack Espy instructed Gavin McNamara to start working on the Hive project today and confirmed that Chris will send the final Strive edits by the end of the day (00:39:53). Jack Espy agreed to the $7,500 for the Strive project and requested that Gavin McNamara send the Stripe link for payment (00:30:49). Payment for the Hive project will be made once it is complete .
Hive Project Implementation and Timeline Jack Espy requested that the Hive project, focused on a red holiday theme and character comment integration, be "somewhat done" by Monday or Tuesday of the following week (00:30:49). The holiday theme will involve a bright red background, Christmas string lights on the homepage, snowfall throughout the page, updated holiday photos, and incorporating the four holiday character skits sequentially starting with the first video on November 1st or 2nd (00:33:11) (00:37:53). The goal is to have all four holiday videos live by Christmas (00:36:07).
Follow-up Meeting Scheduled A 15-minute gut-check meeting was scheduled for the following day at 3:00 to 3:15 PM to review the Hive project's progress and direction (00:40:48). Jack Espy and Gavin McNamara also discussed establishing end-of-week check-ins to run through analytics and optimize the website based on data (00:42:39).

Gavin McNamara will include the first holiday character skit video on the Hive site and prepare to add one new video every week from December 1st to the 15th.
