Notes
Website Updates
Gavin is finishing up a customer project, including updates for Strive and Hive, and has everything teed up for the changes on the Strive site.
They discussed holding off on a detailed review of all website updates until after the weekend, as Gavin needs to focus on pivoting and implementing the prioritized edits.
Jack mentioned that while they have design help, she takes a long time on tasks, so they are considering starting with hourly work and possibly moving to a retainer model for maintenance on both sites.
The Strive site awaits video content to complete the holiday-themed updates on the vodka crayon section and the hero section.
Gavin noted that he could duplicate pages (e.g., the landing page) and switch between versions as needed.
Holiday Imagery & Product Photos
Jack and Gavin brainstormed on humorous reviews for the site, including a one-star review from the Grinch and a five-star review emphasizing a heart growing, to be used as a marketing tactic.
They discussed making the hero section on the site very holiday themed, with clever phrases like “find your hive” interwoven with the holiday spirit.
They planned to generate AI images for the Spirited Hive vodka can and carton – for example, a render of the product sitting at the base of a Christmas tree on Christmas morning with festive decor.
Ideas for additional images include: Santa-themed images, reindeer visuals (with humorous dialogue such as “yo, Rudolph, you try this Hive stuff yet?”), and a version with characters like Herbie holding the product with a speech bubble.
Gavin emphasized the need for high resolution (up to 8K) and accurate details (such as correct spelling on the can and case) when generating the AI images.
AI Integration & Ads
Gavin demonstrated how AI (using the Chat GPT web browser) is being used to visualize website layouts and update descriptions in real-time, even showcasing the ability to generate holiday-themed page designs.
He explained a theory about AI’s rapid capability doubling, noting that updates are coming in days rather than months.
Gavin mentioned that his Google Ads campaign was entirely overhauled overnight thanks to AI integration across his social media and ad platforms.
Jack brought up Brooklyn’s issues with an AI solution (integrated with DMs) that was overly intrusive, and both agreed that AI solutions should simplify tasks rather than add complications.
About Us Page & Mission Statement
Jack dictated new copy for the About Us page, focusing on his founder story and the creation of Strive Soda based on his love for great-tasting beverages and a commitment to hydration and wellness.
The copy emphasized that Strive Soda is sweetened 100% with organic wildflower honey and avoids synthetic sugars like sucralose and aspartame.
They discussed the need to update and perfect the mission statement to be punchy, meaningful, and aligned with their brand values, with ideas including revisions to emphasize that the soda “actually makes you feel good” rather than just “energize.”
Both agreed to send the draft to Chris for feedback before finalizing and uploading the copy to the site.
Other Discussions & Scheduling
Jack shared his travel plans (being in South Carolina, heading to San Diego, Austin, Moab, Nashville, and back to Florida) while discussing technical issues like inconsistent WiFi setups and the high costs proposed by providers.
Gavin and Jack joked about personal AI chat quirks, humorous comparisons to MySpace, and the rapid evolution of AI, together with light-hearted banter about WiFi and system infrastructure.
They agreed to connect later to further nail down pricing and future collaboration—potentially shifting to monthly or retainer arrangements once the immediate projects are completed.
Both reaffirmed their commitment to quality work and mutual trust, as Gavin expressed his dedication to precise execution and Jack appreciated the support, even making arrangements to help Brooklyn with her AI issues.
