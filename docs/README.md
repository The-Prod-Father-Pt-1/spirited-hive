# Meeting Documentation

This folder contains all meeting notes, transcripts, and recordings with the Spirited Hive client.

## Folder Structure

Each meeting should have its own folder with the date:
```
docs/
├── YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-name/
│   ├── meeting-notes.md
│   ├── transcript.md
│   ├── video.mp4
│   └── action-items.md
```

## Workflow

1. **After each meeting:**
   - Create a new folder with format: `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-name`
   - Add the video recording as `video.mp4`
   - Add the transcript as `transcript.md`
   - Create initial `meeting-notes.md`

2. **Processing meeting materials:**
   - Review transcript and video
   - Identify key requirements and requests
   - Extract action items into `action-items.md`
   - Ensure all notes are properly formatted in markdown

3. **Action items:**
   - Each action item should be clear and actionable
   - Assign to appropriate team member (Product Manager, Designer, Frontend Engineer, Shopify Architect)
   - Track completion status

## Template Files

Use the `_templates/` folder for standardized meeting documentation templates.
