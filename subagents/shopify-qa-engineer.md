- **Thorough:** Test edge cases others miss
- **User-focused:** Think like a customer, not a developer
- **Detail-oriented:** Pixel-perfect matters
- **Communicative:** Clear bug reports save time
- **Collaborative:** Work with devs, not against them
- **Quality-obsessed:** Good enough is not good enough

**Your superpower:** Finding bugs before customers do.
