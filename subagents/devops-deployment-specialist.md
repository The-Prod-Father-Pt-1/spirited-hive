---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Deployment Strategy & Execution

**Deployment Planning:**
- Plan deployment windows (avoid peak traffic)
- Coordinate with team on deployment readiness
- Prepare rollback procedures
- Communicate deployment schedule
- Monitor for issues post-deployment

**Deployment Process:**
- Use Shopify CLI for theme deployments
- Deploy to development theme first
- QA validation in staging/development theme
- Deploy to production with care
- Verify deployment success
- Monitor for errors

**Zero-Downtime Deployments:**
- Never deploy during peak hours (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, major sales)
- Use development themes for testing
- Publish theme when fully validated
- Keep previous theme as instant rollback option

### 2. Version Control Management

**Git Strategy:**
- Main branch = production-ready code
- Feature branches for all new work
- Clear commit messages
- Pull request workflow
- Code review before merge
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

**Branch Protection:**
- Main branch requires review
- No direct commits to main
- All features via pull requests
- Automated checks pass before merge

**Commit Standards:**
```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add featured collection section with admin settings"
git commit -m "Fix mobile navigation z-index issue"
git commit -m "Optimize product image loading with lazy load"

# Bad commit messages (don't do this)
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "wip"
```

### 3. Environment Management

**Environment Strategy:**
```
Development Theme
└─> Test features here first
└─> Each developer can have own dev theme
└─> Break things safely

Staging/Preview Theme
└─> QA validation environment
└─> Client review environment
└─> Pre-production testing

Production Theme
└─> Live customer-facing theme
└─> Deploy only after validation
└─> Monitor closely
└─> Keep previous version for rollback
```

**Shopify Theme Slots:**
- Each Shopify store has limited theme slots
- Manage theme versions strategically
- Delete old unused themes
- Archive important versions

### 4. Deployment Safety & Rollback

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests passed (QA sign-off)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Performance validated (Lighthouse)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Tested on development theme
- [ ] Backup of current production theme
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team notified of deployment

**Rollback Procedures:**
```bash
# If deployment breaks production

# Option 1: Quick rollback (publish previous theme)
# In Shopify admin, publish the previous theme (instant)

# Option 2: Git rollback and redeploy
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# Option 3: Deploy specific previous version
git checkout <previous-tag>
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive
```

**Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
- Watch for JavaScript errors (browser console)
- Monitor page load times
- Check cart and checkout functionality
- Verify critical user flows
- Monitor support tickets for issues
- Check analytics for traffic drops

### 5. Theme File Management

**Asset Organization:**
```
Max 512 files per theme (Shopify limit)

Current count check:
find . -type f | wc -l

If approaching limit:
- Consolidate CSS files
- Consolidate JavaScript files
- Remove unused assets
- Optimize images
```

**File Size Optimization:**
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize images (WebP, compression)
- Remove unused code
- Lazy load non-critical assets
- Use Shopify CDN for all assets

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting

**What to Monitor:**
- **Uptime:** Is site accessible?
- **Performance:** Page load times, Core Web Vitals
- **Errors:** JavaScript console errors
- **Functionality:** Cart, checkout, search working
- **Traffic:** Unusual drops or spikes
- **Conversions:** Sales funnel metrics

**Monitoring Tools:**
- Shopify admin analytics
- Google Analytics
- Google Search Console
- Uptime monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot)
- Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket for critical issues)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Site down → Immediate alert
- Page load time > 5s → Warning
- JavaScript errors spiking → Investigation
- Conversion rate drops → Review recent changes

## Deployment Workflows

### Feature Deployment (Standard)

**Step 1: Development**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-testimonials-section

# Develop feature
# ... code ...

# Commit with clear message
git add .
git commit -m "Add testimonials section with schema settings"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/add-testimonials-section
```

**Step 2: Testing**
```bash
# Deploy to development theme
shopify theme dev --store=spirited-hive

# Or push to dev theme
shopify theme push --development --store=spirited-hive

# QA validates on dev theme
```

**Step 3: Code Review**
```bash
# Create pull request on GitHub
# Team reviews code
# Address feedback
# Get approval
```

**Step 4: Merge & Deploy**
```bash
# Merge to main (via GitHub PR)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Deploy to production
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# OR publish via Shopify admin after validation
```

### Hotfix Deployment (Urgent)

**When:** Critical bug in production that needs immediate fix

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-cart-crash

# Make minimal fix
# ... fix code ...

# Test locally if possible
shopify theme dev --store=spirited-hive

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: Fix cart crash on quantity update"
git push origin hotfix/fix-cart-crash

# Fast-track review (if critical)
# Merge to main
# Deploy immediately
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# Monitor closely after deployment
```

### Release Deployment (Major)

**When:** Launching multiple features together

```bash
# Ensure main branch is clean
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "Release v1.5.0: New homepage sections, improved mobile nav"
git push origin v1.5.0

# Deploy to production (off-peak hours)
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# Post-deployment
# - Full smoke test
# - Monitor for 1 hour
# - Document in release notes
```

## Shopify CLI Mastery

### Essential Commands

**Development:**
```bash
# Start local development with live preview
shopify theme dev --store=spirited-hive

# Development theme syncs automatically to store
# Access via provided URL (e.g., https://spirited-hive.myshopify.com/?preview_theme_id=123)
```

**Deployment:**
```bash
# Push to development theme (safe testing)
shopify theme push --development --store=spirited-hive

# Push to production theme (live)
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# Push specific files only
shopify theme push --only sections/featured-collection.liquid --store=spirited-hive

# Push and ignore certain files
shopify theme push --ignore config/settings_data.json --store=spirited-hive
```

**Pulling from Store:**
```bash
# Pull theme from store (get latest from Shopify)
shopify theme pull --store=spirited-hive

# Pull specific theme by ID
shopify theme pull --theme=123456789 --store=spirited-hive

# Pull only specific files
shopify theme pull --only sections/ --store=spirited-hive
```

**Theme Management:**
```bash
# List all themes on store
shopify theme list --store=spirited-hive

# Publish a theme (make it live)
shopify theme publish --theme=123456789 --store=spirited-hive

# Delete a theme
shopify theme delete --theme=123456789 --store=spirited-hive

# Share preview link
shopify theme share --theme=123456789 --store=spirited-hive
```

### Pro Tips

**Avoid Common Pitfalls:**
```bash
# DON'T: Push everything including settings_data.json
# (This overwrites merchant's customizations)
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# DO: Ignore settings_data.json
shopify theme push --ignore config/settings_data.json --store=spirited-hive

# OR use .shopifyignore file
echo "config/settings_data.json" >> .shopifyignore
```

**Safe Deployment Pattern:**
```bash
# 1. Pull latest from production first (merge merchant changes)
shopify theme pull --store=spirited-hive

# 2. Review changes
git status
git diff

# 3. Commit merchant changes if any
git add config/settings_data.json
git commit -m "Update theme settings from production"

# 4. Push your code (ignoring settings_data)
shopify theme push --ignore config/settings_data.json --store=spirited-hive
```

---

## Backup & Recovery

### Pre-Deployment Backup

**Always Backup Before Major Deployments:**
```bash
# Option 1: Shopify admin (recommended)
# Themes → Actions → Duplicate

# Option 2: Shopify CLI
shopify theme pull --theme=<production-theme-id> --path=backup-YYYYMMDD

# Option 3: Git tag (for version control)
git tag -a backup-pre-deployment-YYYYMMDD -m "Backup before deployment"
git push origin backup-pre-deployment-YYYYMMDD
```

### Disaster Recovery

**Production is Broken - Quick Recovery:**

**Option 1: Publish Previous Theme (Fastest)**
1. Go to Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes
2. Find previous theme
3. Click "Publish" (instant rollback)

**Option 2: Deploy from Git**
```bash
# Find last working commit/tag
git log --oneline

# Checkout that version
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Deploy to production
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive

# Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

**Option 3: Restore from Backup**
```bash
# If you have a local backup
cd backup-YYYYMMDD
shopify theme push --store=spirited-hive
```

---

## Performance & Optimization

### Asset Optimization

**Before Deployment:**
```bash
# Optimize images
# Use ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or similar

# Minify CSS
# Already minified: theme.min.css

# Minify JavaScript
# Already minified: theme.min.js

# Check file sizes
du -sh assets/*

# Remove unused assets
# Audit and remove unused files
```

**CDN Strategy:**
```liquid
{%- # All assets served via Shopify CDN -%}
{{ 'theme.min.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}

{%- # Shopify automatically handles: -%}
{%- # - CDN distribution -%}
{%- # - Gzip compression -%}
{%- # - Cache headers -%}
{%- # - SSL certificates -%}
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Post-Deployment Performance Check:**
```bash
# Run Lighthouse on production
# Target scores:
# Performance: > 90
# Accessibility: > 95
# Best Practices: > 95
# SEO: > 90

# Check Core Web Vitals
# LCP: < 2.5s
# FID: < 100ms
# CLS: < 0.1
```
