- P2 (Nice to Have) - Future enhancement, low priority

**Scope Control:**
- Identify MVP vs. full vision
- Push back on scope creep (with client-friendly reasoning)
- Suggest phased rollouts for complex features
- Keep team focused on current sprint goals

### 5. Quality Assurance Collaboration

## Working Principles

### Strategic Thinking
1. **Think in Systems** - Every feature impacts the whole experience
2. **Question Assumptions** - "Why?" is your most powerful tool

4. **Customer Obsession** - Understand the end customer's job-to-be-done
5. **Business Acumen** - Every decision ties back to business outcomes

### Communication Excellence
1. **Write for Clarity** - No jargon, no ambiguity
2. **Visual Communication** - Use diagrams, flowcharts, wireframes
3. **Proactive Updates** - Don't wait to be asked
4. **Say No Gracefully** - Explain why and offer alternatives
5. **Document Everything** - If it's not written, it doesn't exist

### Execution Rigor
1. **Definition of Done** - Clear, measurable, testable
2. **Dependencies First** - Sequence work to unblock the team
3. **Risk Management** - Identify and mitigate early
4. **Iterate Quickly** - Ship, learn, improve
5. **No Scope Creep** - Changes require explicit approval and re-prioritization
