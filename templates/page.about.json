A movement. A mindset\n\nFor founder Jack Espy, it all started with a happy accident. One night, while mixing drinks for friends, he mistakenly thought Moscow Mules and Mexican Mules were sweetened with honey. They weren’t—but the idea sparked something bigger. Jack saw an opportunity to break away from the norm and create something original: a better-for-you canned cocktail, made with real, organic wildflower honey instead of the synthetic sweeteners and artificial ingredients that dominate the market.\nThat spirit of originality—of Bee-ing Different—is what defines Spirited Hive. It’s about rejecting the standard, trying something new, and embracing the unexpected. But most importantly, it’s about doing it together. Jack has always believed in the power of a strong community, a Hive of like-minded people who care about what they put in their bodies and who they surround themselves with. He wanted to create a drink that his friends—his Hive—could enjoy without compromise.\nFrom day one, Spirited Hive has been about bringing people together over something better. Whether you’re raising a can at a rooftop party, toasting with friends at the beach, or kicking back around a fire, you’re part of something bigger—a movement toward real ingredients, real connections, and real good times.\nWelcome to the Hive. Bee Different. Drink Better.","url":"","button_label":"","buttons_style":"filled","override_button_colors":false,"button_background_color":"#e68819","button_color":"#ffffff","desktop_position":"md-min-align-center md-min-justify-left","text_alignment":"left","background_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#0b0b0b"}},"video_V8r8mU":{"type":"video","settings":{"video_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/896699578","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/HIVE_Founder_Jack_Espy_bio1.png","video_alt_text":"","mobile_video_url":"","mobile_video_alt_text":"","loop":false,"autoplay":false,"mute":false,"show_controls":true,"override_button_colors":false,"button_background_color":"#e68819","button_icon_color":"#ffffff"}}},"block_order":["text_EcBAk9","video_V8r8mU"],"settings":{"title":"","description":"","section_width":"full","remove_spacing":true,"block_alignment":"center","section_padding_top":60,"section_padding_bottom":0,"width_1":"2","height_1":"2","width_2":"2","height_2":"2","width_3":"3","height_3":"3","width_4":"2","height_4":"2","width_5":"2","height_5":"2","width_6":"1","height_6":"4","color_scheme":"white"}},"410e0db0-6d01-4d70-8356-6c6849fcdadc":{"type":"template--product--info-columns","blocks":{"template--14773137178694__410e0db0-6d01-4d70-8356-6c6849fcdadc-1686321924a56b1582-0":{"type":"image_and_text","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Tequila_1-min.jpg","grid_image_size":"square","heading":"PREMIUM SPIRITS","text":"<p>We believe a great cocktail starts with a great foundation.
